About me
======
I'm am currently a PhD student at Northeastern University in the CS Theory Group where I am fortunate to be advised by [Soheil Behnezhad](http://behnezhad.com/) and [Mahsa Derakhshan](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/derakhshan/).

I am broadly interested in **theoretical computer science**. More specifically, I am interested in designing algorithms for large scale graphs such as the **streaming model** or models with uncertainty such as the **stochastic model**.
